    <p> Service is a very important part of my life. I absolutely love being able to help others in whatever way I can, whether that is inside the workplace or in my personal life.
    I have been serving in different organizations from a young age mostly because I was following my Dad around at that time but as I have gotten older I have still been actively serving in several areas.
    Most recently I volunteered with an organization called <a href="https://impactretreat.com/">Impact Retreat</a> over the summer and led a group of incoming freshman students throughout the week of camp.
    This experience allowed me to grow further in several skills such as communicating with a team, leading groups of students in both a large and smaller setting.
    My biggest take away from my time working with Impact is the importance of frequent effective communication.
    During the spring semester, as the counselors were preparing for camp over the summer we would meet once a week to go over more of what our roles would look like at camp as well as review the material we had gone over in the previous weeks.
    The repetitiveness seemed redundant at first, however, I quickly realized how this repetition made it easier to ensure everyone was on the same page about what we would and would not be doing as counselors.
    I also had the privilege of leading the FCA (<a href="https://www.fca.org/">Fellowship of Christian Athletes</a>) chapter at my high school during my senior year.
    This position put me in a lot of uncomfotable situations at the time, but now looking back I am so thankful for these situations becuase they allowed me to grow in my interpersonal, leadership, and public speaking skills.
    As the president of FCA I got to lead weekly member meetings as well as plan and coordinate other events with the FCA leaders at the monthly leadership meetings.
    Currently I volunteer and serve on the worship team and media team at my church <a href="https://www.grace-bible.org/campus/anderson">Grace Anderson Campus</a> and later this semester I will be applying to serve on the roadie team with <a href="https://www.breakawayministries.org/">Breakaway Ministries</a> starting next semester.
